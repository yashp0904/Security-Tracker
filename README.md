> **"Test Early. Detect Deep. Deploy Secure."**

The **Software Security Testing Portal (SSTP)** is a full-stack web application that empowers developers and QA teams to perform, manage, and visualize security testing across all stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
It integrates vulnerability assessment, test reporting, and governance-driven insights to ensure software assurance and early defect detection.

---

##  Abstract

The **Software Security Testing Portal** provides a unified platform for security-focused software testing.
It supports developers and testers in identifying vulnerabilities, prioritizing risks, and maintaining a continuous record of software security health.

This project aligns directly with the **Software Development Security (CE6013)** syllabus by demonstrating **secure coding, risk-based testing, and governance integration** in real-world environments.

---

##  Objective & Purpose

### **Objective:**

To build a centralized and interactive system that facilitates security testing, vulnerability management, and assurance reporting in software projects.

### **Purpose:**

* Enable **early vulnerability detection** during development.
* Encourage **secure testing practices** across all SDLC phases.
* Support **data-driven risk analysis** for decision-making.
* Promote **security awareness and governance** among teams.

---

##  Problem Statement

Traditional testing models often treat security as an afterthought.
Most teams face these issues:

* Vulnerabilities discovered only post-deployment.
* Poorly structured reports with limited prioritization.
* No single platform for collaboration or visibility.

The **Software Security Testing Portal** addresses these issues by integrating **testing, visualization, and governance** under a single intuitive dashboard.

| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Security testing done post-release    | Integrated testing during development                |
| Lack of structured vulnerability data | Centralized dashboard with filters & charts          |
| Poor risk prioritization              | Severity-based vulnerability scoring                 |
| No collaboration                      | Role-based access control (Admin, Tester, Developer) |
| Manual report generation              | Automated exportable PDF/CSV reports                 |

##  Core Features

###  **User Authentication & Roles**

* Secure JWT-based login/signup system.
* Role-based access for **Admin**, **Tester**, and **Developer**.
* Admins manage projects and user assignments.

###  **Project Management**

* Add or import software projects with details like repo link, tech stack, and owner.
* Assign testers to specific projects for scanning.

###  **Security Test Execution**

* Upload source code files or URLs for scanning.
* Simulated or actual scan integration (Bandit, Safety, OWASP ZAP).
* Automatically classify vulnerabilities by severity (Critical → Low).

###  **Dashboard & Visualization**

* Interactive graphs for vulnerability distribution and trends.
* Filters by severity, project, or tester.
* Metrics on scan history, top risk categories, and security posture.

###  **Reporting System**

* Export scan results as **PDF** or **CSV**.
* Include summary: total vulnerabilities, mean risk score, project health index.
* Ideal for audits and internal reporting.

###  **Optional Notifications**

* Real-time alerts on detected vulnerabilities or completed scans.
* Activity feed for project updates.
