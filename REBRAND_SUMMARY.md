## 5-Commit Strategy Explained

### Commit 1: Remove Lovable Branding
- Files: `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `index.html`
- Purpose: Clean removal of Lovable-specific content

### Commit 2: Rebrand Project Title
- Files: `package.json`, `index.html`, `README.md`
- Purpose: Update project name and descriptions

### Commit 3: Clean Dependencies
- Files: `package-lock.json`, `package.json`
- Purpose: Remove unused Lovable packages

### Commit 4: Update Metadata
- Files: `index.html`
- Purpose: Finalize SEO and meta information

### Commit 5: Documentation Cleanup
- Files: All remaining changes
- Purpose: Ensure complete removal of old references

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Atomic Commits**: Each commit has a single, clear purpose  
✅ **Clean History**: Easy to understand what changed and why  
✅ **Rollback Friendly**: Can revert specific changes if needed  
✅ **Professional**: Shows attention to detail in git management  
✅ **Traceable**: Makes code review easier  

## Next Steps

After running the commits:

1. Review the changes: `git diff HEAD~5`
2. Push to remote: `git push origin main`
3. Update any deployment configurations
4. Update any CI/CD pipelines if applicable

## Notes

- All source code files (src/*) remain unchanged
- No functionality was altered
- This is purely a rebranding operation
- The app will run exactly the same as before
